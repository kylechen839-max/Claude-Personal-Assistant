# Progress

Run all tests with `pytest` (from the project root, venv active).

## Stage 1 - Core chat ✅
- `assistant/chat.py`: `ClaudeChat` keeps conversation history, adds a short
  spoken-style system prompt plus the current local date/time, and calls the
  Messages API. Model comes from `CLAUDE_MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-4-5`).
  A failed request is rolled back so history stays valid; long histories are
  trimmed so they always start with a plain user turn.
- `assistant/cli.py`: text-mode loop (`python -m assistant --mode text`).
- Tested by `tests/test_chat.py` with a mocked Anthropic client (history,
  system prompt, error rollback, trimming, exit words, the text loop).

## Stage 2 - Text to speech ✅
- `assistant/tts.py`: a `TTS` interface (`speak`, `save_to_file`) with
  `Pyttsx3TTS` (offline OS voice: SAPI5 on Windows, eSpeak on the Pi),
  `PiperTTS` (offline neural voice via the `piper` CLI, a drop-in upgrade),
  and `PrintTTS` (no audio). `make_tts(name)` picks one.
- `assistant/audio.py`: wav read/write, resampling to 16 kHz, chime, playback.
- `--mode speak`: typed input, spoken replies.
- Tested by `tests/test_tts.py`: renders real pyttsx3 speech to a .wav and
  asserts it exists, is non-empty, and is not silent; Piper CLI invocation is
  mocked; wav round-trip/resample.
