# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Dev team dashboard: a Grid view shows every Claude Code session as a
  live status tile (working, needs you, idle, done, failed), next to the
  Runs view. A Chat panel reads a session's recent messages and sends it
  one message per press of Send; unsent drafts stay per session in the
  open page only.
- Dev team dashboard: desktop launchers open it in its own Chrome or Edge
  window on Windows and macOS (`tools/agent-dashboard/desktop/`).
- Dev team: a read-only agent run dashboard (a private claude.ai page,
  source in `tools/agent-dashboard/`). One row per `/build-feature` run;
  the page itself flags runs that have gone quiet past their phase's limit.
  PR-ready, blocked and dead runs untouched for 7 days count as done.
- Dev team: `/build-feature` writes a status row at each phase, marks a run
  done when its PR is merged or closed, and stops a phase that runs past
  its time limit with a blocker note.
- Dev team: an hourly watchdog marks runs whose session died and sends at
  most one phone push per session, including "needs you (approval)" when a
  run waits on a permission prompt.

## 1.0.2 (2026-10-19)

- If the saved sign-in file can't be read, phone access tokens are refused
  (fail closed), the same as browser cookies.

## 1.0.1 (2026-10-19)

- Failover with history turned off now remembers "Sign out everywhere"
  across restarts (saved in `[webapp] sessions_file`).

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-19)

The first full release: the voice assistant from the seven original stages,
plus a phone app, hands-free conversation, conversation history, a cloud
server and Pi -> PC -> cloud failover. Details and test notes per feature are
in PROGRESS.md; security decisions in SECURITY.md; data handling in
PRIVACY.md.

### Voice assistant (stages 1-7)
- Claude chat with conversation history and a short spoken-style system
  prompt; model from `CLAUDE_MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-5-5`).
- "Hey Claude" wake word (openWakeWord, custom `keywords/hey_claude.onnx`),
  chime, record until silence, faster-whisper `base.en` on CPU, follow-up
  window without repeating the wake word.
- Tools: Google Calendar (list, create, move, delete), Notion assignments
  (list upcoming, set Status), web search and page reading. Deletes always
  ask for a spoken yes.
- Long-term memory in Pinecone: relevant notes before each reply, a short
  summary after each conversation, `search_memory` and `remember` on request.
- `config.toml`, rotating log file, friendly errors when the network or the
  API is down, `python -m assistant` entry point, `--check` setup doctor.

### Phone app (iPhone home-screen web app)
- `python -m assistant --mode web`: push-to-talk with the phone's real mic,
  typed questions, streamed replies, spoken answers, tap-to-confirm deletes.
- Hands-free voice conversation like Claude's voice mode: on-device voice
  activity detection, sentence-by-sentence streamed speech, interrupt by
  talking over it, spoken confirmations that only count after the question
  was heard.
- Sign-in code with per-address lockouts (the right code always works),
  server-side sessions, "Sign out everywhere", strict CSP, no third-party
  scripts.
- History screen: every conversation saved; search, continue, rename, pin,
  archive, export, delete; voice commands to find and reopen conversations.

### Voices
- Kokoro (`af_heart`) as the default natural voice when downloaded
  (`--download-voice kokoro`), first audio in about 0.4 s by speaking the
  first clause early; Piper and pyttsx3 fallbacks; optional ElevenLabs.
- Original soft earcons for listening, thinking and ended.

### Where it runs
- Windows PC: `scripts/install_windows_service.ps1` installs supervised
  startup tasks (web app, optional wake word) and power settings.
- Raspberry Pi: systemd service, preflight check, arm64 CI, migration plan
  (PI_MIGRATION.md).
- Render: Docker image running as a non-root user, CloudGuard auth wall,
  request and upload limits, persistent disk for history and sessions
  (render.yaml Blueprint).
- Failover for the phone app: Pi first, then PC, then cloud, with history
  synced between them as an event log (deletes are permanent everywhere).
- Signed automatic updates from the `stable` branch, which CI promotes only
  when every test passes. Off by default; requires a signature from a key in
  your own allowed_signers file.

### Extras
- Pinecone MCP connector for Claude (pinecone-mcp/).
- Coordinator voice page and Hey Claude Pocket artifact for quick use from
  the Claude app.
